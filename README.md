## **About the game**

This is a dice rolling game that you play with two dice and a lot of luck. 

## **How to play : -**

The game at the begining asks for players names. 

Initially the dice are at position six. After starting the game, each player has to roll the dice. There are  six lives for each player which are denoted with the help of small dice.
The one with non-zero lives is the winner and the one with zero life is the loser.

## **How the game works : -**

So, basically using Random, the dice values are determined and using a bit of animation the dice are rolled. 

The main logic behind the game is that, if the value of the die for Player 1 is less than the value of the die for Player 2, then Player 1 will lose a life and vice versa. If both the players have same value for the dice then nothing will happen and the players have to roll again.
<br />The game continues untill either Player 1 or Player 2 reaches zero life, and the one with the remaining non-zero lives will be the winner.
